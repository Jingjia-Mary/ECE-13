This lab is about how to progamming a calculator with matrix using functions.

This lab contains files BOARD.c/h, MatrixMath.c/h, mml_test.c.

This lab is about reading the matrixmath.h to write a completely new c document named mathrixmath.c that includes all the calculation steps for matrix. The hard part for the lab is understanding the matrixmath.h because this is the main branch of this lab doing it wrong the whole lab will not work. **By reading the lab manual there are functions and explanation for each different matrix calculation.** This could help and understand the aspect of this lab and prgram the document correctly. 

I approch the lab with the step that is on top of each different claculation, the explanation at the end of the manual, and with mathmatic help for the calculation functions. The hard part is changing the mathmatic functions in to lines of code and the bugs that had been create while complie it. The hardest part will be change the determinant function and inverse function into C programing code, sence it is already pretty hard for mathmatic calculations.The bug that I had met is declare the float value and the complier said I did not use the variable, but at the end I am able to fix the bugs for the MatrixMath.c document. 

I spend a long time on the MatrixMath.c document while trying to change functions into coding. The part that I do not like is the algorithm for the function coding. The explanation for matrix transpose could be more easier, it is a little hard to understand by just given the result.
