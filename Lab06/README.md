JunLai for debugg the controller bugs for the bounce buttons.

This lab is about how to progamming a basic IO function on a microcontroller using buttons on the controller. 

This lab contains files BOARD.c/h, Ascii.h/c, Buttons.c/h, Leds_Lab06.h/c, Oled.h/c, OledDrive.h/c, ButtonsTest.c, bounce_adc.c, bounce_buttons.c, bounce_switch.c, bounce_timers.c.

This lab is about use the IO functions to write out servarl programs that will show on the coolterm and the controller itself. While running the lab, the buttons could jump up and down, switch the light on or off, turn the cricle plate on the controller to see the value change, and lastly see the timer changes. **This lab is showing the basic functions toe see how the controller will change throught out different program runs while connect with the kit.**

I approch the lab with first writting all the four state for the kit while running it. In this way, I will know how much functions or state I need to worried about, this could give me an order on which part or state is next. Then next I went out to write all of the test for the buttons in order starting with abc and end with the switch. Doing this step by step with the lab manual's order will not lost track and knowing where will it go. Lastly withe the test that need to write for lab 6. To finish the lab with the testing case for the microcontroller. To check the programm, I debug the program everytime I finish with one of them, not checking with controller just check the bugs that I might wrote while writing out the code. When everything is set, I take out the controller and connect it to check the final value or buttons for the lab. 

I spend a long time on the debugging the controller value and buttons, the last step for me to finish this lab assignment. This take me the longest because I need to set the value and buttons to where the lab manual had said and this also means debug my codes if nessesary. This lab is worth a try because after this I have a basic understanding of what the controller could do instead of just printing out HelloWorld. All the buttons, switch, and trunning plates now I have an idea of what it is and what it could do.
