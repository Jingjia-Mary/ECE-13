Junhao Lai, helped me with bugs which is remove sort.c from project to build it; and explanation for the lab to get understanding of the listing order.

This lab is about how to progamming a sorting function using lists and words.

This lab contains files BOARD.c/h, LinkedList.c/h, sort.c, LinkedListTest.c.

To my lab, the insertsort is slightly faster than the slecetionsort. This is what I expected that insertsort is faster. 

This lab is about reading the LinkedList.h to write a completely new c document named LinkedList.c that includes all the implement functions for the sorting. **Write out the implement for both LinkedList nad sort to produce the test in order to observe the faster sorting type.** **Reading the manual to understand the lab and understanding the list order to perform the test for linedlist. **

I approch the lab with first understanding the order of the linkelist file, so I know the order of the previous and next item then be able to manipulate the order to code the function out. This is the important part of the lab. The only thing that went wrong is that I did not figure out that I need to remove the sort.c when I try to run my own, and remove my own test while run sort.c. This is the bug that deal with me the longest time. Other than this is pretty fine.

I spend a long time on the LinkedList.c document since it had more implement function than sort.c. This had end up fine, I happily finished my lab because I won the war with the ful that ful which had hit me nearly three weeks. I spend about two full days on this lab. The suggestion will be the explanation on the order of the linkedlist part. The order of the Linkedlist could be very frustrating, so a little bit more explanation on this would help a lot.
