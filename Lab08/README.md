This lab is about how to progamming a direction map by entering the 4 directions on the Linux Shell.

This lab contains files Game.c/h, Player.h/c, UNIXBOARD.h, Lab08_main.c.

This lab is about use the MpLab to write out a programs that will generate as a rpg map running on the Linux shell system. **While running the lab, the game will give out directions and ask which direction that the player willing to go, then then game will give out the result of that direction or continue to play the game to the last direction will show.** 

I approch the lab with first copy all the outline from the h doc to c doc. In this way, I will know the functions I need to write about. Then I start to read the directions and hints had given in the h file to wirte the required code for each function. At the same time reading the manual and translated manual help me writing out this lab too. Also, I met some new bugs that deal with the order of different functions, such as which functions that need to go first to make the program run. And I need to work on my writing skill sence I constantly type the wrong charactor to produce several bugs that make no sense. To check the programm, I debug the program everytime I finish with one of them.

This lab is kind of easy compare to the last lab that we have done and shorter. The manual explained everything very clearly. The only thing that could change a bit is the example map for the lab that we use to check our program. The example is kind of hard to understand by giving out the table.
