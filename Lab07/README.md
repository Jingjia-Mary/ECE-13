JunLai helped me on understanding the lab easier sense it is hard and debug the bugs that I do not really understand why.

This lab is about how to progamming a basic oven function on a microcontroller using buttons on the controller then show it on the coolterm.

This lab contains files BOARD.c/h, Ascii.h/c, Oled.h, OledDrive.h, Lab07_main.c and Led.h.

This lab is about use the IO functions to write out a programs that will show on the coolterm about cooking oven. While running the lab, the buttons will work as a cooking oven. **This lab is showing the complex functions to see how the controller will work throught out different ovenstate runs while connect with the kit.**

I approch the lab with first writting out the header file for Leds. In this way, I will know the functions or state I need to worried about, this could give me an idea on the functions that I need to implement and write out. Then I start to file in and define all the functions that I need to done on the main file. At the same time reading the manual and translated manual help me writing out this lab too. To check the programm, I debug the program everytime I finish with one of them, not checking with controller just check the bugs that I might wrote while writing out the code. When everything is set, I take out the controller and connect it to check the final value or buttons for the lab.

I spend a long time on the main file, the logic and the way I need to return and set to the pointer is confusing. This take me the longest because I am so confused about the logic and at the same time I am a person who is really bad on understanding a gaint logic that will conlaid with each other. This lab is a pretty hard lab to complete. The lab manual could be more easier to understand for students like me and more detailed.
