This lab is about how to progamming a calculator with rpn style with stack functions.

This lab contains files BOARD.c/h, rpn.c/h, stack.c/h, rpn/stack_test.c, lab4_main.c.

This lab is about reading the rpn.h to write a completely new c document named rpn.c that includes all the calculation steps for the reverse calculator. The stack.h is the prototype fuctions for the calculator, and create a c file that will implement the prototypes functions. Then write out the rpn string in the main file. **The hard part for the lab is understanding the rpn.h and the calculator itself because this is a new type of calculation for me.** By reading the lab manual there are explanation of what should include in each file. This could help and understand the aspect of this lab and prgram the document correctly.

I approch the lab with doing a research on what is a rpn calculation online and got help and idea from it. Before this lab I do not know anything about this calculation. So, to me not onlt the assignment is completely new. After understand what is a rpn calculation then I start to read the manual to see the required work for the assignment. The file rpn.c went wrong most of time because not only bugs need to debug also calculation step or function need to be make sured. 

I spend a long time on the rpn.c document while trying to change functions into coding. This is also the part that I hate about because it is so hard. Maby add some explanation of what is a rpn calculator would be very great.
