JunLai helped me on understanding the lab, expalin the lab easier, help me to choose the easy portion of the lab sense I work alone. He also help to to check and debug the code.

In this lab, I worte Agent and Message. The files are agent.c and message.c. It also contain other h and c help files. 

This lab is about to create a battleship game that play by the play and the AI computer. There are total four portion for this lab, but only two need if work alone. The agent contains all of other three portion of the lab. Agent is not the main file but it connects all together. When everything is done, the game should start and play with the computer AI to determine who win or lost the game. 

I approch the lab with first writting out the Agent c file. I started with the most important file. This one is not easy because it connects all together but I have other to left blank, so it is pretty hard to complete with. I have to keep asking the ta, tutor, and other tutor that actullay tutor other class to help me explain the lab easier so I can understand it. Then I went and start to finish the message part. This part is easy because I only need to call, break and encode or decode all of the message that had been sent by the player and the AI. I just need to call to make sure the number of the row and columns, the guess number and the actual number, then encode or decode it to see it is succucess or failed.

I spend a long time on Agent file because I work alone and sence I choose meesage then it means I do not need to do field and negotiation portion. This had give me a big trouble sense the agnet file connects it all together. After a hard time of writing the message alone in the agent file. I choose to rewrite the agent file by adding the field and negotiation portion in to help me understand better. I would help a lot by point out which part could be skip when do not need to do the other two part.
